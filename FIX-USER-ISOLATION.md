# CRITICAL FIX: User Data Isolation Issue

## ðŸš¨ SECURITY BREACH IDENTIFIED

**PROBLEM:** All users can see each other's medications, schedules, and logs!

**ROOT CAUSE:**
1. RLS policies exist but aren't enforced consistently
2. `setUserContext()` not called before every database query
3. Some queries use admin client which bypasses RLS

## âœ… IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED:

### 1. Ensure setUserContext is called EVERYWHERE
Every database call must set user context FIRST.

### 2. Check Supabase RLS Status
RLS must be enabled on all tables in Supabase dashboard:
- medications
- schedules  
- medication_logs
- sms_reminders

### 3. Verify Policies Are Active
Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('medications', 'schedules', 'medication_logs');

-- List all active policies
SELECT tablename, policyname, permissive, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

### 4. Test User Isolation
1. Login as User A â†’ Add medication "TestA"
2. Logout â†’ Login as User B â†’ Add medication "TestB"
3. User A should ONLY see "TestA"
4. User B should ONLY see "TestB"

## ðŸ”§ FILES TO FIX:
- server/supabase-db.js: Add userId checks to ALL methods
- server/enhanced-server.js: Pass userId to ALL db calls
