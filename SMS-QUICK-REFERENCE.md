## 🚀 Next Steps (Required)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

**Go to your Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Open: https://app.supabase.com/
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Click **New Query**
5. Open this file: `database/sms-tracking-migration.sql`
6. Copy all the SQL code
7. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
8. Click **RUN**

**What this does:**
- Creates `sms_reminders` table
- Adds tracking columns to `medication_logs`
- Sets up indexes for performance

### Step 2: Configure Twilio Webhook

**For Local Testing (using ngrok):**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start your server
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Start ngrok
ngrok http 8080
```

Then:
1. Copy the ngrok HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
2. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/incoming
3. Click your phone number
4. Under "Messaging Configuration" → "A MESSAGE COMES IN":
   - Webhook: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/sms/webhook`
   - HTTP POST
5. Save

**For Production:**
1. Deploy your app to Render/Railway
2. Use your production URL instead: `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/sms/webhook`

## 🔍 Example Flow

### Scenario: Morning Aspirin Reminder

**09:00 AM - Reminder Sent**
```
Database: Creates entry in sms_reminders
         medication_id: 1
         schedule_id: 3
         status: "sent"
         
SMS to User: "💊 Time to take Aspirin (500mg)
              Reply YES when taken or NO if skipped."
```

**09:05 AM - You Reply "YES"**
```
Twilio → Webhook → Your Server

Server Processes:
1. Finds sms_reminder for your number + schedule
2. Updates sms_reminder:
   - response_received: true
   - response_text: "YES"
   - status: "responded_yes"
3. Creates medication_log:
   - status: "taken"
   - logged_via_sms: true
4. Decrements medication quantity
5. Sends confirmation SMS

SMS to User: "✅ Great! Marked as taken. Stay healthy! 💊"
```

**09:06 AM - Check App**
```
Dashboard shows:
- Aspirin: ✅ Taken (via SMS)
- Quantity updated
- Log entry created
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to reply to every SMS?**
A: No, you can still log medications manually in the app. SMS is optional.

**Q: Can I reply hours later?**
A: Responses are matched to reminders within a 2-hour window for accuracy.

**Q: Does this work for multiple people?**
A: Currently supports one USER_PHONE_NUMBER. For multiple users, you'd need to extend the system.

## 🆘 Need Help?

1. Check server logs: Look for 📱 emoji in console output
2. Check Twilio logs: https://console.twilio.com/us1/monitor/logs/sms
3. Check Supabase: Verify tables were created
4. Test webhook: Use Twilio's webhook testing tool

**Common Issues:**
- ngrok URL expired → Restart ngrok and update Twilio
- Webhook not working → Check URL has /api/sms/webhook
- No response → Verify webhook is POST, not GET
- Wrong status → Check sms_reminders table in Supabase
